The assignment was to write a recursive, greedy and dynamic solution to the following problem:

There are hotels along a road and there's a salesman that wants to figure out at which hotels he should stop overnight to minimize a cost function, the cost function is just the squared delta from the optimum distance per day which iirc is 100.
